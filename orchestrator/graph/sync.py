"""Regenerate a project's roadmap graph from its built source.

The I/O half of `orchestrator.graph`: find the project's modules, run the
prover's dependency probe over them, fold the result into
`roadmap/graph.json` with `reconcile`, and write the file back.

Run it once a pass, on the checkout you pulled and rebuilt after the
pass's merges landed. It refuses unless the artifacts are up to date with
the source: the probe reads compiled artifacts, and importing a module
whose source has since changed silently yields its last built state, so a
graph derived from a stale checkout describes an earlier commit and
nothing downstream can tell. It asks the build tool rather than building,
since a reader must not rebuild what it reads. `check=True` answers
"would this change anything?" without writing, which is the form a
scheduled job on the default branch wants: the regeneration is
idempotent, so a non-empty answer means a merge landed without one.

Only the orchestrator runs this. The gate verifies pull requests and
never writes to a checkout, and a contributor's branch has no reason to
carry a plan edit — the graph is the overseer's map of the project, kept
on the branch only the orchestrator pushes to.
