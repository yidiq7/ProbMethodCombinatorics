"""Fold a probe's dependency report into a project's `roadmap/graph.json`. Pure.

The plan's edges are a claim about the project's own declarations, and
the built environment already knows the answer, so they are derived
rather than maintained. `reconcile` takes the graph as parsed JSON and
the probe's `DeclDependency` records and returns the graph it should
be, leaving the file, the probe and the clock to the caller.

**What it writes.** Every declaration the project's source declares gets
a node, and every node whose declaration is formalized gets its `uses`
and `proof_uses` rewritten from the environment. A helper proved inside
someone else's pull request is a declaration like any other: it is the
thing later work reuses, and a plan that omits it draws the theorem
above it as resting on nothing.

**What it will not touch.** Anything a term cannot answer for. A node
whose `statement` is still `planned`, one marked `upstream`, and a
`group` are left exactly as they are: there is no term to read, and
whatever is written there is the orchestrator's intent, which a tool that
cannot see it would simply erase.

Two narrower cases of the same rule, and they are the ones easy to get
wrong:

- **An edge to an `upstream` node stays.** The probe reports the
  project's own declarations, because an edge to every library lemma a
  proof touches would bury the plan. A dependency on a named library
  result is a fact about the plan that nothing here can rediscover, so
  it is carried across rather than dropped.
- **`proof_uses` is derived only once the proof exists.** A declaration
  still carrying a placeholder has no proof term, so its `proof_uses` is
  not a stale reading of one — it is the route the orchestrator intends
  to take, written down before the proof that will justify it. `uses`
  has no such problem: the statement's type is there either way.

Status fields (`statement`, `proof`) on an existing node are the
orchestrator's to write when work lands, so they are read here and never
rewritten.
