# Chapter 8: Janson Inequalities

Zhao, *Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics* (MIT 18.226), Chapter 8.

Janson's inequalities bound the probability that a random subset contains **none** of a
prescribed family of sets, and more generally the lower tail of the count.  Where the second
moment method (Chapter 4) gives polynomial decay, these give exponential decay.

Setup 8.1.1 throughout: `R` is a random subset of `ι`, each element kept independently with
probability `p` — Mathlib's `setBernoulli` — and `A i` is the event `S i ⊆ R`.  The dependency
set `D` is a parameter rather than something computed from `S`, exactly as in
`variance_sum_indicator_le`: any `D` containing every dependent ordered pair is admissible, and
a larger `D` only weakens the bound.

Nothing in this chapter is in Mathlib.

`Set.ncard` rather than `Finset.filter`, because set inclusion on `Set ι` is not decidable and
the project does not introduce `Decidable` instances. -/

/-- **Janson's inequality I** (Zhao, Theorem 8.1.2): the probability that the random subset
contains none of the `S i` is at most `exp (-μ + Δ/2)`.

Most useful when `Δ = o(μ)`; Harris' inequality (Chapter 7) gives the matching lower bound
`exp (-(1 + o(1)) μ)` in that regime, so the two together pin the probability down. -/

/-- **Janson's inequality II** (Zhao, Theorem 8.1.8): in the regime `Δ ≥ μ`, where the first
inequality says nothing, the probability of containing none of the `S i` is at most
`exp (-μ² / (2Δ))`.

Proved from the first inequality by applying it to a random subsample of the events. -/

      ≤ Real.exp (-(jansonMu p S) ^ 2 / (2 * jansonDelta p S D)) := by
  sorry

/-- **Janson's inequality III** (Zhao, Theorem 8.2.2): the lower tail of the count.  For
`0 ≤ t ≤ μ`,

    ℙ(X ≤ μ - t) ≤ exp (-t² / (2(μ + Δ))).

Taking `t = μ` recovers the first two inequalities up to a constant in the exponent, so this is
the strongest of the three.  There is deliberately no companion for the *upper* tail: Example
8.2.4 shows the analogous bound is false, since planting a clique forces an excess of triangles
at far higher probability than any such bound would allow. -/
