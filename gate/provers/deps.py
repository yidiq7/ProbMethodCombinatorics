"""Shared dependency-probe runner, sibling of `gate.provers.trust`.

`collect_dependencies` is the one place that knows how to turn a
`ProverProfile`'s `dependency_command`/`parse_dependencies` hooks into
an actual subprocess run: build the probe (the command-builder hook
writes the probe file as a side effect and returns the argv to run it),
execute it in the workspace, and parse the captured output into
`DeclDependency` records.

What the probe reports is the *elaborated* environment, so it answers a
question no text scan can: which of a project's own declarations a
proof term actually reaches. That is what a roadmap's dependency edges
claim, which is why they can be regenerated rather than maintained by
hand.

Two failure modes are kept distinct from a result, because both would
otherwise read as "this project has no dependencies" and a caller
writing that into a plan would erase every edge the plan had:

- a prover with no probe raises `ProverError` rather than returning
  `[]`, and
- a nonzero subprocess exit — a broken build, a missing binary, a
  module that does not import — raises rather than returning whatever
  the probe managed to print first.

The probe needs a *built* project, since it reads compiled artifacts
rather than re-elaborating. Against an unbuilt or half-built checkout
the import fails and the nonzero exit carries the reason.
